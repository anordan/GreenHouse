	   <h3 class="readWilting">Q1: My plant is wilting</h3>
	   
	   <div class="wiltingContent">
	   <p>Dry soil is by far the most common cause of plants wilting. Tip: Water deeply. After watering, use a shovel to dig into the soil (away from the root system), to see moisture levels three to four inches below the surface.</p> 
	   <p>If it's dry at this depth, your plant's roots are not getting enough water.</p>
	   </div>
	   
	   <h3 class="readYellow">Q2: My plant has yellow leaves</h3>
	   
	   <div class="yellowContent">
	   <p>Moisture stress. The most common reason that plants' leaves turn yellow is because of moisture stress, which can be from either over watering or under watering. If you have a plant that has yellow leaves, check the soil in the pot to see if the soil is dry.</p>
	     </div>
		 
	   <h3 class="readBurnt">Q3: My plant looks burnt</h3>
	   
	   <div class="burntContent">
		<p>Leaf tip browning is an annoying condition that commonly affects certain types of houseplants. Spider plants, tropical plants, and those with long, strappy leaves are especially susceptible.</p>
		<p>The main difficulty when confronting leaf tip burn is to remember that it's a symptom of a larger problem (usually a cultural issue), as opposed to a condition in itself. So once your plant has burned leaf tips or margins, there's no way to reverse the damage at that wounded location.</p>
		</div>

	   <h3 class="readBrown">Q4: My plant has brown spots</h3>
	   
	   <div class="brownContent">
		<p>When houseplants get brown tips on their leaves, it's generally an indication of poor watering habits. The best way to water a houseplant is to thoroughly flush it until water runs freely out the drainage holes. Shallow watering can cause brown tips on the leaves.</p>
