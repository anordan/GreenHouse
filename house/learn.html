	  <h3 class="readLight">Sunlight: How important is sunlight for my plant?</h3>
	 
		<div class="lightContent">
		<p>Very important! Plants capture energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. During this process, certain wavelengths of light are captured by the plant’s chlorophyll pigments, while other wavelengths of light are captured by the plant’s phytochrome pigments.</p>
		
		<p>These wavelengths are used to assist the process of photosynthesis, and drive other important biological functions of your plant.</p>
		
		<p>Different plants have different light-level needs, based on the way that they have evolved.</p>
		
		<p>For example, forest-dwelling ferns have evolved to need less light than desert-dwelling succulents. Knowing what type of environment a plant is native to will help you determine what kind of light it will be happiest in. To determine what kind of light your apartment or office has, start by figuring out what direction your windows face. Remember, the sun rises in the east, swings to the south, and sets in the west.</p>
		</div>
	 
	<h3 class="readDirection">Direction: Which direction should my plants face?</h3>
	
	<div class="directionContent">
		<p>South windows - brightest, most intense, direct light East/West windows - bright to medium, but not as intense, indirect light North windows - medium to low, indirect light</p>

		<p>Once you’ve figured out what direction your windows face - see what is outside your window! If your window faces south, but there’s a shady tree or large building in the way, the amount of light could be greatly reduced and more similar to that of a west-facing window. The same is true if you have thick curtains in front of your windows that you rarely open. (Open them up and let the light shine in! Or replace them with a sheer fabric. Your plant will thank you.) Here’s a quick way to determine what kind of light you have - ‘the hand test’. At mid-day, spread your hand out about a foot above where you plant to put your plant. Now look at your hand’s shadow - if you see a:</p>
		
		<p>Well-defined shadow - bright light Fuzzy shadow but still recognizable as a hand - medium light Only faintly discernible shadow or no shadow - low light</p>
</div>
		
	<h3 class="readLong">Duration: How long should my plants be in the sun?</h3>
	
	<div class="longContent">
		<p>Remember that the duration of light is important, too. If your south-facing window only receives one hour of direct sunlight a day, then it would be considered more of a east/west-facing, medium light window. Ideally, most bright light plants like succulents and cacti need 6+ hours of direct sunlight, or a full day of bright, indirect light. Most medium light plants like an hour or two of direct sunlight, and bright, indirect light for the rest of the day. And most low light plants like a full day of lower, indirect light, and to be a little further away from the window.</p>

		<p>There’s an old adage among horticulturists - “The darkest shade outside is the same as the brightest light inside.” This is true even if your window receives bright, direct sun. Why? Because outside, light comes from all directions! Inside, it only comes from one direction - your window. As the seasons change, so will the quality and directionality of your light. Keep an eye on where the sun is at different times of the day. If, in summer, the sun swings high over a building to shine directly in your window, it may not shine in your window when it swings low in the winter.</p>

		<p>Plan your plant placement appropriately and change seasonally, if necessary. Supplemental lighting can be used in cases where either existing light is not enough to keep your plant healthy and happy. The best supplemental lights will come from the red and blue LED light bulbs that were designed with the specific wavelengths that plants need. You can also get away with a CFL bulb in the “warm” region ( less than 2700) in the Kelvin spectrum (Kelvin doesn’t mean anything with regards to light for plants).</p>

		<p>Remember, plants don’t see light the way that we see light!</p>

		<p>What we may see as a brightly lit room (by lamps, not sunlight) may be completely dark to the plant. White light is made up of the three primary colors of light - red, green, and blue. Most white indoor lights for humans are rich in light in the green spectrum, with only a little red and a little blue. But plants are green because they reflect green light away from themselves, and absorb blue and red light. Because of this, if you decide to use a supplemental light, you’ll need a specialized plant light bulb (with red and/or blue wavelengths) for your green friend.</p>
