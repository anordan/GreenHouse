	<p>There are over 300 species of Aloe, but only one species is used for medicinal purposes- Aloe vera. Aloe vera, or true Aloe, is a member of the family Asphodelaceae, and has its origins in northern Africa. The specific origins of Aloe vera are quite murky, although they are believed to originate from the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt.</p>
	
	<p>There is quite a bit of variation in individual aloe plants- they can range from distichous to rosette-forming, and be spotted or not, and the leaf margins could be dentate or not. Such variation within the same species has led to the rise of the theory that Aloe vera is not a species at all, but rather a natural or ancient hybrid.</p>
	
	<p>The cultivated variety of Aloe vera has been known and used since ancient times, and is well-documented in ancient Egyptian and ancient Mesopotamian records. Aloe is even referenced in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, as part of the skin-preservation process during mummification. Known, during life, for its skin-healing properties, aloe gel has been used throughout time as a treatment for skin ailments.</p>
	
	<p>Aloes are closely related to Gasterias (Gasteria) and Haworthias (Haworthia), and the jury is still out with regards to species placement within the genera and ultimately, the family.</p>

	<div class="pothosContent">
	<p>Epipremnum aureum, or pothos, is a tropical vine native to French Polynesia and surrounding Islands. Usually grown in a hanging basket, it is one of the easiest houseplants to care for, so long as its basic needs are met. Pothos comes in several cultivars of variegation and color- Jade, Neon, Marble, and Golden. Pothos is very forgiving, and will resiliently grow back, if the plant has been through a rough patch.</p>

	<div class="cactusContent">
	<p>Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves.</p>
